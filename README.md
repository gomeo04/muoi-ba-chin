European eyes are watching this election closely, after 13 years of governments under Mark Rutte. The winner could end up with less than 20% of the national vote and fewer than 30 seats in the 150-seat parliament, unprecedented in Dutch politics.

Paul Heckingbottom is set to be sacked as Sheffield United manager within the next 24 hours.



Appointed permanent manager in November 2021, Heckingbottom guided United to the top flight with a second-place Championship finish last season.

Former manager Chris Wilder is among the leading contenders to take over.

Following defeat at Burnley, Heckingbottom criticised the club for making "financial rather than football decisions" by selling key players in the summer following promotion.

The 46-year-old said United were "let down" by some of his players at Burnley, who had never won a Premier League game by five goals. Victory lifted them off the bottom of the table at United's expense.

United are four points from safety, have won only once this season and have a goal difference of minus 28.

They host second-placed Liverpool at Bramall Lane on Wednesday.
