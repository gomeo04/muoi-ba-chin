Although almost everyone in the world now breathes air that is polluted in some way, the unfolding story of air pollution is one of environmental inequality.
The government predicted as many as five million Chinese tourist arrivals by the end of the year - still less than half the nearly 11 million who came in 2019. But a big improvement on last year, when there were only 270,000.

Every time Mithilesh turns on her stove to cook, her eyes begin to burn. The small home the 29-year-old housewife shares with her husband, daughter, son and elderly in-laws in the slums of the Indian capital Delhi quickly fills up with smoke, making it hard for anyone to see.

Mithilesh has cooked over a traditional chulha – a metal coated combustor stove that uses firewood as fuel – since she was 13 years old. She often has difficulty breathing and experiences uncontrolled bouts of coughing.

But even when she steps outside her home, there is little respite. Delhi, the world's second largest megacity, has some of the worst outdoor air quality in the world. Although the authorities in India have been making strides to improve air quality in the city, levels of multiple pollutants regularly exceed World Health Organization (WHO) limits. One recent study published by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago warned that the lives of residents in India's capital are being cut short by up to 11.9 years compared to if air pollution was reduced to levels recommended by the WHO.

Mithilesh and her family are an extreme example of something happening globally. Although almost everyone in the world now breathes air that is polluted in some way, those who are worst hit are also the least able to protect themselves or escape from it. The story of air pollution is one of environmental inequality.

A 2014 cost-cutting decision to switch the city's water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River - polluted by decades of heavy industry - had disastrous consequences, exposing its people to lead poisoning and turning tap water to various shades of brown and yellow.

The city's drinking water is now judged to be safe, the city is still not, with violent crime running at nearly four times the United States' national average.

Shields keeps walking, and talking, as she drops in the Gucci analogy. It could sound flippant if it wasn't entirely in keeping with the American's zealous insistence that her life's low points are to be channelled.

She believes her harrowing history - explained, named, and put out in the open - can help others.

Flint's water crisis was far from Shields' first challenge.

"At first, I thought my purpose was to be a great boxer. But God wanted me to be a great boxer and to tell my story because it's going to save so many lives," she says.

Shields is a natural storyteller. She has the words, the stories, the confidence. In a week filming for BBC Sport's Born to Brawl series, the tales just fall out of her.

She can trash talk with the best in the world - high praise in boxing, a sport which values running your mouth as much as running the show in the ring.

But, unlike a lot of her counterparts in both women's, and men's boxing, her narrative has depth. Unspeakably dark depths.

An extended period of sexual abuse began when Shields was just five years old.

"I've had to work harder than a lot of people to get to where I am," she says. "I don't know people who could have been in the same situations and get to where I've made it to…

"I'm talking about from the age of five, when I was raped as a young girl to, you know, having to deal with all the anger I had from that.

"I had a speech impediment, I couldn't even talk till I was about six and I stuttered till I was nine.

"Flint has built that no-quit attitude in me. I remember being a kid and this girl chasing me home from school. I ran in the house and my mum was like, 'What's going on?' I'm like, 'These girls are trying to fight me'. And she was like, 'Tomorrow when you go to school, you better fight every last one of them!'.

"And so I went to school the next day and I fought a girl at school and then I fought these other girls on the way home from school and everyone just knew don't mess with Claressa."

That lesson of fierce self-sufficiency was a constant for Shields. Her father went to prison when she was two and was only released when she was nine. Her mother was an alcoholic and Shields has spoken of her mother's intermittent unexplained absences, and the constant scratching around for money.

She remembers sacrificing meals so her siblings could eat.

"Getting ready for the [London] Olympics I was growing up still in poverty," she says. "I was 16 years old, living with my mom, me and my siblings, and you know she didn't have it together.

"So we had a place to stay but we were still having to go some days hungry and I didn't have a bed to sleep in.

"That's one thing I did when I won the Olympics, first thing I did was bought me a bed."

But, despite those early experiences, Shields' overwhelming message is to lean into hope, not despair.

"There's so many kids that are going through similar things I went through," she says. "And they feel hopeless.

"But God wanted me to use my story to tell them. So they can see. Look I made it, you guys can too.

"I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy, that's how bad it was, and I have a few enemies."

One is Savannah Marshall. The Briton is the only person to beat Shields across her 12-year senior career, both amateur and professional.

That defeat came at the 2012 World Championships in China, a loss followed by an unbeaten decade and, an act of revenge in October 2022 at London's O2 Arena when the American beat Marshall by unanimous decision to become the undisputed middleweight champion.

Shields defended that undisputed crown against Maricela Cornejo in June, taking her pro record to 14-0, and has been clear about her feelings regarding a Marshall rematch next year: Yes, but only on US turf.
